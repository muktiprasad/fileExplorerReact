I have implemented the tree structure for the files, added a delete icon, but on click of
that I am getting the node id and calling existing function in api.js, butsomehow it is
not working.

Due to time constraint, have not wrote the test cases, and just focussed on
functionality than look and feel.

Let me know if you need any more info in this.

Referred some of the code from below URL
https://codesandbox.io/s/file-explorer-forked-s1npw?file=/src/index.js:233-243

To run the application, just cloen the repo, and do a npm i, then npm start
